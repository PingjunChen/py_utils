Auto Generate Requirements.txt
----------------------------------------

### Why requirements.txt?
Any application typically has a set of dependencies that are required for that application to work. The requirements file is a way to specify and install specific set of package dependencies at once.


### Tools
Use pipreqs - pipreqs used to generate requirements.txt file for any project based on imports


### How to use?
```
$ pip install pipreqs

$ pipreqs /path/to/project

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
