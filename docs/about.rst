About pydaily
================

`pydaily <https://github.com/PingjunChen/pydaily>`_ package is a collection of
functions and utilities used in my daily research. I organize all these
functions together mainly for following reasons.

- Figure out how to write a python package and upload to
`pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pydaily>`_.

- Avoid reinventing the wheel all the time. After all, life is short.

- Expect this package can be of help to the community, especially those in
working in computer vision, machine learning, biomedical image analysis. I also
look forward for contributors to improve the package.

- For the spirit of `open source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement>`_.
Sharing is growing.
