About pydaily
================

[pydaily](https://github.com/PingjunChen/pydaily) package is a collection of
daily used functions and utilities in my routine research. I organize all these
functions together mainly for following reasons.

1. Figure out how to written a python package and place it in
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/pydaily).

2. Avoid reinventing the wheel all the time. After all, life is short.

3. Expect this package can be of help to the community, especially those in
working in computer vision, machine learning, biomedical image analysis. I also
look forward for contributors to help improve the package.

4. For the spirit of open source, to share and grow together.
