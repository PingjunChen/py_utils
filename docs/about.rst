About pydaily
================

`pydaily <https://github.com/PingjunChen/pydaily>`_ package is a collection of
functions and utilities used in my daily research. I organize all these
functions together mainly for following reasons.

1. Figure out how to write a python package and upload to `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/pydaily>`_.

2. Avoid reinventing the wheel all the time. After all, life is short.

3. Expect this package can be of help to the community, especially those in working in computer vision, machine learning, biomedical image analysis. I also look forward for contributors to improve the package.

4. For the spirit of `open source <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_movement>`_. Sharing is growing.
